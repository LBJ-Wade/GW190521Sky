# Checking Claimed AGN Association with GW190521

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://binder.flatironinstitute.org/~wfarr/GW190521Sky)


This is a quick notebook that performs a rough check against the claimed AGN association with GW190521 in [Graham, et al. (2020)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.251102) now that the LIGO results in [Abbott, et al. (2020)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.101102) and [Abbott, et al. (2020)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aba493) are available.

If you want to try out these sorts of calculations, you can run this notebook or create your own using the [Flation Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/) Binder via the button above.  Note that you will have to re-download the PE samples manually (use `curl` on the link in the notebook) because they are not stored in the repository.
