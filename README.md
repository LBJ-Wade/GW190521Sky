# Checking Claimed AGN Association with GW190521

This is a quick notebook that performs a rough check against the claimed AGN association with GW190521 in [Graham, et al. (2020)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.251102) now that the LIGO results in [Abbott, et al. (2020)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.101102) and [Abbott, et al. (2020)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aba493) are available.
